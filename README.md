##Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project - Smartphone accelerometer data
This script assumes that the data has already been downloaded and unzipped to the current
working directory. For reference, the URL for the zip file to be downloaded is:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

It was not necessary to utilize all of the raw accelerometer data (Intertial Signals) 
contained within this zip package in order to complete the objectives of this assignment.

A description of the data, variables, and transformations is contained within CodeBook.md.

The tidy data sets are obtained from the run_analysis.R script. The subsetted mean and
standard deviation data is contained in the dataframe combinedSubsetted, and the 
summarized data is contained in the dataframe summarizedData.
